# Queue

Queue is an open source project for creating a simple queue management system. The unique proposition is that there is no custom backend system. Queue management utilises [trello](https://trello.com) as a backend system. The frontend system is deployed to [netlify](https://netlify.com). Optional SMS reminder can be enabled and sent with a combination of [Zapier](https://zapier.com) [Twilio](https://twilio.com).
